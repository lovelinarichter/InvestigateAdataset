# Investigate A Dataset

Project: Investigate No Show Medical Appointment in Brazil

## Description

For this project, the task is to analyze a dataset and then communicate the findings. I was interested in analyzing the dataset of No Show Medical Appointment in Brazil. The dataset is a collection of information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. The analysis is focused on the question, whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

This project has four components:
1. Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets
2. Investigate it using NumPy and pandas. 
3. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question.
4. Finaly, finish by communicating the findings.

## Installation
Install Anaconda libraries of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
